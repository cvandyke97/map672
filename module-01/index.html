<h2>## The manifesto feels pretty conventional to me. I don’t say that to be dismissive, but as someone who’s been around UK’s Geography Department and critical human geography for a number years, it is very much a product of the strains of critical thinking which have dominated Geography since the late-1990s. It makes arguments I expected to see — that maps reflect and are constitutive of the world; that they are infused with power and can be mobilized to either reinforce or contest those sources of power; that maps are imperfect and partial stories that reflect and embody the material world. None of these claims I’d object to. It was refreshing to see the argument that aesthetics matter but that in a hurry they can be irrelevant. For me, this speaks to a utilitarian ethic which understands maps as tools that are sometimes needed in a hurry, and that perfecting their look can just be plain unimportant. Although I appreciate a visually appealing map as much as anyone, what ultimately matters is the story it communicates, and this can be incidental to its appearance. Perhaps what I found most surprising — and maybe lacking — is that the six axioms do not contain any references to the emancipatory potential of maps. Now, I concede there are traces of this sentiment throughout the manifesto (e.g., its discussions of Bill Bungee and Gwendolyn Warren and the work maps have done to highlight social inequalities or injustices). So, is there an additional point that needs to be made, one that suggests maps have latent emancipatory or liberating potential? Of course, thorny questions then arise such as — emancipatory for whom? There’s always the potential that one group’s emancipation can trigger another’s immurement. Presumably, the idea would be to use maps to assist socially marginalized/disempowered groups in order to give them representation they would not otherwise have access to. 

I’ll hit on a couple other points very briefly. At this stage, my primary goal is to improve my mapping and coding skills. Critique is fine, but I’ve moved on from the point in my academic career when it preoccupied my attention — too often critique winds up being self-referential and fails to meaningfully contribute to reassembling a more just world. 

As an aside, I’d be curious to know if the manifesto represents the culmination or end of Floating Sheep — it’s more or less gone offline. </h2>
